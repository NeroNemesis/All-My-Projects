# All-My-class-Projects
Here you'll have bundle files of all the class projects I participated in.

How to open/view a bundle file :
1- Create an empty directory (in the same directory as the bundle file). This is where the files will be displayed
2- In your command line interface or git bash (be sure to be in the directory where the bundle file is contained), 
run git clone file.bundle targetdir. Where targetdir is the name of the repository you created in step 1.

*Note that you have to do these steps for every sinfle bundle file.

Thank you, Gilles Djawa Ndjankeu.
